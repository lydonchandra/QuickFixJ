3 distinct application:

1. banzai, which is copied from quickfixj example
   This is just a very simple trading client that sends order to "executor" (which fulfils orders right away)

2. executor, fulfils orders by accepting it from banzai

3. my test application, written according to tutorials at http://globalengineer.wordpress.com
  - BakerCapital, initiator, connects to
  - LanFongOMS, acceptor
